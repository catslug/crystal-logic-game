crystals! a game of randomness and strategy

You can give this curiously entertaining game a try at the live link: https://catslug.github.io/week-4-game/

## Overview: 
This game tests your memory and ability to strategize. You'll be given a random number between 19 and 120 as your goal. Each of the crystal creatures in the game will have a hidden value between 1 and 12. As you click each crystal creature, your total will start to increment until you either match or exceed the random number goal set when the game begins. Matching the goal number exactly will increment your wins, exceeding it will increment your losses. Then you'll be given a new goal number and each crystal creature will be randomly reassigned a new value between 1 and 12.

## Icon Design: 
Crystal creatures were drawn and designed by me.
